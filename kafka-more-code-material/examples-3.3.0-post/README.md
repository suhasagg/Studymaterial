# Confluent Examples

This repository contains code examples for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) and the
[Confluent Platform](http://www.confluent.io/product).

* **[kafka-streams](kafka-streams/)**: examples that demonstrate how to implement real-time processing applications using
   [Kafka's Streams API](http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/) aka "Kafka Streams", which is a new stream processing
   library included with the [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) open source project
* **[kafka-clients](kafka-clients/)**: example Kafka client applications such as a Java producer application
  (for writing data to Kafka) and a Java consumer application (for reading data from Kafka)
* **[kafka-connect-streams](kafka-connect-streams/)**: examples that demonstrate various ways to get data into a Kafka topic,
   loaded into the Kafka Streams API `KStream`, and then some basic usage of the Kafka stream processing API
