Just before handing the payment over, however, he would pull the piece of paper back and pen an elaborate doodle on the opposite side.\n\n\"An original from the master Dali. I will never cash this check,\" would inevitably be the reply from the starstruck restaurant owner thrilled to be gifted an artwork that would doubtless be of greater value than the amount on the check itself.\n\nBy perfecting the magic checkbook technique, Dali would rarely, if ever, have to pay for his dining habits.\n\nPeople might not hoard the recently revealed 100 Norwegian Krone ($15) banknote in the s"

It brings $5.4 billion into the local economy -- and creates over 20,000 jobs. \n\n\"I can't imagine what the area economy would look like if we didn't have the market,\" said Tom Conley, CEO of High Point Market Authority. \n\nRay Wheatley and his wife Lisa own the Real Kitchen & Market, a High Point catering business.

	   "(CNN) -- Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages may make certain cells in your body age faster, a new study suggests.\n\nThe study, published this week in the American Journal of Public Health, concludes that sugar-sweetened soda consumption prematurely ages white blood cells. The University of California, San Francisco researchers say sugary sodas may impact the health of these white blood cells on a scale that is comparable to smoking -- that people who drink soda on a regular basis put themselves at a higher risk for diabetes, heart disease and stroke.\n\nResearchers studied white blood cells in healthy adults, specifically looking at the ends of the study participants' chromosomes, called telomeres.\n\nThese telomeres are essential to cell division and naturally get shorter with the passage of time. When a telomere gets too short, its cell dies. Thus, scientists believe longer telomeres mean you're healthier and younger, while shorter telomeres mean you're less healthy and aging faster.\n\nRes"

This is an Italian-American success story after all.  \nShares of Fiat Chrysler began trading on the NYSE Monday under the ticker symbol FCAU. Fiat Chrysler opened at $9 and quickly moved as high as $9.55 before pulling back a bit. \n \nChrysler hasn't been publicly traded in the United States in more than seven years. At that time it was known as DaimlerChrysler. Daimler  ( DDAIF ) agreed to sell Chrysler to private equity firm Cerberus in 2007. \n \nFiat's stock had previously traded as Fiat SpA  ( FIATY ) in Milan and the United States. Those shares have outperformed GM  ( GM ) and Ford  ( F ) so far this year, largely due to the resurgence of Chrysler -- the smallest of Detroit's Big Three. \n \nChrysler reported a sales increase of 19% in the United States last month compared to a year ago.

The new policy was announced by Attorney General Eric Holder and Deputy Attorney General James Cole in a conference call with federal prosecutors.\n\nLegal advocates have criticized the practice as unethical and as further stacking the deck in favor of the government by putting defendants at a disadvantage.

Overall, Republicans participants tended to stay more toward the middle, voting more neutrally.\n\nNot surprisingly, Democrats and Republicans voted in extreme opposite directions throughout the debate. When Crist attacked Scott's personal fortune, Democrats and independents strongly agreed with him.\n\n\"If you're somebody like Rick Scott, and you have a private jet, and you fly 30,000 feet above people all the time, or you live in an oceanfront mansion, you're out of touch, and you're not feeling what people that are watching "

	   "Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton used her Tuesday appearance in Colorado, where experts see the female vote deciding a number of statewide races, to court women with a personal message about her life and her hopes for the future.\n\nClinton usually targets women voters in her appearances. But in Colorado, the former secretary of state and likely presidential candidate in 2016, spoke about how fortunate she felt to be born in America and the message she hopes to be able to leave with children.\n\nThe personal remarks, while focused on turning out voters for Democrats Mark Udall, John Hickenlooper and Andrew Romanoff, sounds a great deal like a presidential candidate and resembled a message Clinton could use should she run for president.\n\n\"I have had a great set of experiences. I have been very fortunate in my life, but the most fortunate thing besides the parents to whom I was born, is that I was born in America,\" Clinton said. \"I, from the moment of my birth, was blessed because of that"

	   "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) There's yet another Internet bug that threatens to make your private conversations public. The new enemy: \"Poodle\" attacks. Normally, your Web browser uses software to encrypt your conversations. New versions of that software make encryption more robust over time. But with the Poodle attack, a hacker can force your browser to downgrade to an old version (SSL 3.0), which is far less secure than today's SSL standard. A browser using the 15-year old SSL 3.0 is vulnerable enough to let hackers spy on the data traveling to and from your computer. That means they could spy on your emails, banking or anything else. Fortunately, this dog's bark is louder than its bite. A hacker must control your computer network to attack with Poodle (unlikely). And Web browser patches are expected to disable this downshift to older security methods. That means this Internet bug isn't as bad as others discovered this year. The Heartbleed bug affected computers everywhere and was the reason "
